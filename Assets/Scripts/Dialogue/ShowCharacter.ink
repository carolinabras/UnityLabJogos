VAR characterType = "Nothing"

Once upon a time...

 * There was a dragon.
~    characterType = "Dragon"
-> dragon
 * There was a knight.
 ~    characterType = "Knight"
-> knight


=== dragon ===
ROAR!
-> finished

=== knight ===
\* Knight noises *
-> finished


=== finished ===
That's the sound a {characterType} makes.
Nice!
-> END
